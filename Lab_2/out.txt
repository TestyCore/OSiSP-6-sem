The sun rises in the east!?!?. Cats enjoy sleeping in warm places.
Learning new skills takes time and practice.?? Birds chirp melodiously in the morning.
Running in the rain can be refreshing. Books open doors to new worlds!!! Laughter is contagious and bring joy.

Trees provide shade on hot summer days. Music has the power to uplift our spirits!

Kindness costs nothing but means everything? Qwer
